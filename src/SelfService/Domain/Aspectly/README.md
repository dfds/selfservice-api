Aspectly is a C# Framework for writing Aspect Oriented Programming.
It is originally created by Jens Andersen and available as a NuGet package with documentation here: https://github.com/jensandresen/aspectly

Due to lack of maintenance leading to security issues, we have transferred what was necessary for our code to work.
